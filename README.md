# Valorating
(Valorant + rating = Valorating)

### What it is

**Valorating** is a rating system for 5v5 custom games. After one extremely unbalanced game, I set out to create a ranking system that can be used to create fair and balanced teams.

Each player's rating is based on whether the game was a win or loss, their average combat score (ACS), and the ratings of the players on the enemy team.

### What I used

I used Python and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to create this. This is my first Python project, and it was actually surprisingly simple to create (thanks Python, screw you C++). This was made in ~3 hours.

### Future plans

I plan to add more features (e.g. confidence level with more games, improved input methods, Discord bot integration) in the future. Stay tuned.

### Sources

I used [this article](https://ryanmadden.net/posts/Adapting-Elo) for the main math logic of calculating the rating and also a lot of [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).
